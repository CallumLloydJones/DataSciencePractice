## Introduction
This project analyzes data from online dating application OKCupid. In recent years, there has been a massive rise in the usage of dating apps to find love. Many of these apps use sophisticated data science techniques to recommend possible matches to users and to optimize the user experience. These apps give us access to a wealth of information that we've never had before about how different people experience romance.


### Objectives
- Scope, prepare, analyse, and create a machine learning model to solve a question.
- Provide a visual representation of the data.
- The algorithm was designed to identify what star sign a person was based on a feature vector containing information users have listed on their dating profiles. 

## Data Science Methodology

### Project Description
Correlation matrices, box plots, and histograms have been used to clearly visualise trends in the dataset. 
Classification models were trained on a large preprocessed dataset, yielding accurate results.

### Data Science Methods
- Data Preprocessing
- Data Visualisation
- Machine Learning
- Predictive Modelling

## Conclusions
All predictive models show accuracy worse than guessing someone's star sign at random. This signals that you cannot estimate someone's star sign based on the given feature vector.
